Welcome Employee #29387478

You have been chosen as a good citizen to ensure prosperity and virtue of our glorious city.
Multiple applicants have been considered for this position, however your outstanding
love for our administration, the values we stand for and the burning desire to aid
those less fortunate than you are made our decision clear.

In this new position you will have to ensure that the information reaching the public is
free from misinformation, propaganda and degeneracy. Each day you will be prompted with
documents and articles and evaluate them according to our values.

If you deem portions of the documents unfit for the public, please do not hesitate to
mark the words in question with our special black marker, so they can later be processed
before releasing them to the public.
